=== Push a Local Repo to GitHub Repo
    1. Create a new repo on Github (the place I plan to push too) without initializing a README or other options at this time.
    2. After committing changes to the local repo it is time to add the remote repo on GitHub to the settings of the local repo.
    3. From the GitHub website use the ++copy++ command to get the URL for the GitHub repo.
    4. Run = ++git remote add origin _remoteGitHubrepoURL_++
    5. ++git remote -v++ verifies that the remote repo on GitHub is now linked with the local repo on the computer.
    6. ++git push origin master++ this command syncs the local repo to the remote repo on GitHub.
