= Fedora-Doc Git Tips
=== Sync Your Fork Pagure Repo with Fedora's Master
1. Add main Fedora repo to your local fork on your local machine
++git remote add upstream https:fedorahttps://pagure.io/fedora-docs/quick-docs.git++ (As example)
2. Sync the Fedora master repo with your fork on your local machine
++git pull upstream master++
3. Sync your now up to date local repo with your remote Pagure fork
++git push origin master++
- This last step only worked when I used the ssh url with my Pagure fork

=== Change Your local Pagure Repo to ssh
1. Check what url your repo is using
++git remote -v++
2. Set your local Pagure Repo to use ssh
++git remote set-url origin ssh://git@pagure.io/forks/mowest/fedora-docs/quick-docs.git++
- Originally, I could not push to my Pagure fork from my local machine when I used the git https url that is offered in the web interface for my fork.
- Of course for this to work you need to upload the ssh key for your local machine to your Pagure account.

=== FranciscoD's Git Workflow for Fedora-Docs
1. ++git clone/pull++ -> update repo
2. ++git branch <branch name>++ to make a new branch for the WIP
3. make changes, run ./build.sh && ./preview.sh -> check preview
4. ++git add++
5. ++git commit++
6. ++git push origin <branch name>++
7. open PR (pull request of your WIP branch) On Pagure
- FranciscoD creates a branch to keep his local master clean and the final copy. He uses a different branch for each page he wants to edit so that he can keep the master clean until the edit is ready to be pushed to the Fedora-Docs Pagure master with a pull request.
